Major Objectives:
	Properly Exception Handling
	Reading & Writing files


---- TODO ----
[x] Make sure I'm parsing the file correctly using RecipeManager
[x] What do I do with duplicate recipes?
	> we throw out the second instance of a recipe when found
[ ] Am I handling all the errors that can be thrown?
[ ] Test to make sure counts are placed at the same index as their respective recipes



---- Testing ----
Testing results recipelist.txt
	> garbage lines
	> Recipe with no name
	> Recipe with missing ingredients
	> Recipes ignore negative ingredient values
	> Recipe with missing ingredients & no name
	> Recipe with varying white spaces between elements
	> Tested for alphabetized result when adding recipes
	> Tested for rejecting duplicate recipes
	
	
	
---- Design Notes ----
we throw out the second instance of a recipe when found
Recipe handles empty names, and negative ingredient values



---- Learning Notes ----
hasNext() --> true   IF   nextLine has no tokens





---- Loading & Parsing the Recipes ----

File IO
Exception Handling


bread recipe manager




ArrayLists & Arrays only

Don't include 0s in final shopping list.

Make sure to sanitize input. He's gonna try to break input as much as possible

Be able to handle negative recipe values



---- Control Structure ----
Store all found recipes from file at runtime, as objects

Only create shopping_list.txt when user prompts




1. Program opens and parses recipelist.txt, creating objects in ram
2. User is prompted to choose a bread to add to shopping list.
4. Can create shopping list (write to file)
5. Can print shopping list (




---- Recipe text format ----

> Ingredients aren't in the same order for each recipe 
> Recipe names can have white spaces
> Recipe text will always have 5 elements




Recipe <recipe_name>
<ingredient> <float_amount>
<ingredient> <float_amount>
<ingredient> <float_amount>
<ingredient> <float_amount>
<ingredient> <float_amount>


---- Parse Algorithm ----

1. If next == 'Recipe'
	THEN: read rest of line for recipe name. Use this to construct object
2. Read next 5 lines, putting each value into the appropriate bucket
