Major Objectives:
	Properly Exception Handling
	Reading & Writing files


---- TODO ----
[x] Make sure I'm parsing the file correctly using RecipeManager
[x] What do I do with duplicate recipes?
	> we throw out the second instance of a recipe when found
[x] Am I handling all the errors that can be thrown?
[x] Test to make sure counts are placed at the same index as their respective recipes
[x] User should be able to choose negative integers for recipe multiples. These should subtract down to zero, but not passed it



---- Testing ----
Testing results recipelist.txt
	> garbage lines
	> Recipe with no name
	> Recipe with missing ingredients
	> Recipes ignore negative ingredient values
	> Recipe with missing ingredients & no name
	> Recipe with varying white spaces between elements
	> Tested for alphabetized result when adding recipes
	> Tested for rejecting duplicate recipes
	
	
	
---- Design Notes ----
we throw out the second instance of a recipe when found
Recipe handles empty names, and negative ingredient values



---- Learning Notes ----
hasNext() --> false   IF   nextLine has no tokens
